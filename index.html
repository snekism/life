<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
instead of venting on reddit and IRC and feel abusing others ears
and eyes, I should publish online. Whoever feels worth spending time
on these words can do it without me feeling like a self absorbed
asshole much. I believe writing helps a lot, better thinking,
diffusing negative emotions.. so I'm gonna do it a bit.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
I went to a job interview, I was anxious, didn't want to go. It
failed due to misunderstandings but I felt almost happy for a
minute.
</p>

<p>
What made this ? having a place to go every day ? belonging to a
group ? being around toys to play with ? (in that case cars).

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
i have a diploma, some skills, some motivation but at the same time
I start to not give a fuck about all this. I don't want to chase
performance, as if my ego is gone. I don't want money much. I want
stability.. but that may be due to fatigue and lack of control.
Also I want respect and honest appreciation. I work fast and hard
whenever I can. I never stop, never waste time. People are slow,
ranty, unmotivated, or maybe they simply appreciate life
differently. Maybe my brain is hyperanxious and need stimulation all
the time. Maybe I don't care about these people and want to drown in
action to feel happy. A blend of all this.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">

spent 10 minutes setting up github as host for this.  felt real
boring but alas.. I wonder if people are paid for these tasks
sometimes, probably. Not important.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<p>
father is really overwhelming, cranky and heavy.. the more a
situation goes bad, the worst he becomes. Tension makes him more
tense. Nothing surprising.
</p>

<p>
My mother talks about him as a thing. In front of me.. makes me mad.
</p>

<p>
It's still a rotting pot of anger. You know where every move sounds
angry. A door close for no reason, a drawer shut too fast. Dishes
dropped loudly.
</p>

<p>
I should write a note and leave. If I wasn't afraid my parents
wouldn't go violent I'd do so. I guess that's exactly the problem in
these kind of situations.. you don't move because it's a lose-lose
situation with potentially critical consequences.
</p>

<p>
Maybe I should talk to people and find support.

<div id="outline-container-orgd593402" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgd593402"><span class="section-number-2">6</span> work - volunteering</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-6">
<p>
I like volunteering at the food charity. My tasks are basic. The
rhythm is average. People are not in a rush either.  Some would say
they're a charity so obviously they're not in a hurry, but truth is
that most private places I went to weren't faster. Only people
dealing with high rates of clients (restaurants, trains) have hard
rhythm constraints. Oh and high production rate factories. But I
like that.. I don't know why people hate going fast on repetitive
gestures. To me it's like converging toward perfection and then
keeping there for 4 hours. A high zen experience. I'd understand for
physical labour done wrong.. nobody wants to carry 10 tons of stuff
for 4 hours. But even unpacking lots of food can be fun. You just
have to organize yourself to find the easiest and fastest
configuration. Then it becomes a pleasure. Truth is people don't do
this because 1) education (as a programmer I became used to seek
every wasted second) 2) petty revenge due to feud with hierarchy or
other people. Why work fast if your boss talks down to
you.. respect/care/affection is such a big factor in how we work. A
good king could make a whole nation work twice better just by his
appreciation only.

see this pic. a busted synth.. parts out in the open, internals
exposed, design off.

<p>
that thing was an epic item in the 90s, high valued device or toy,
for a high valued art form gone semi-mainstream.
</p>

<p>
but it was fabricated.. yet it's not what it was important for, it's
that glow from how it looks and convey it's use and
capabilities. how you feel and interact with it. how it embodies the
desires and factors of an era.

something that I consider timeless and more important than the
current thinking about innovation. especially the immaterial side of
new tech.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-13">
<p>
trading is a soulless game where someone gives you his money so he
can wait to later be in profit or not.
</p>

<p>
most of the trading is superstitiously weak science (averages
averages averages fib series averages)
</p>

<p>
but it has some general life lessons:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>follow others for a while
benefits are easier</li>

<li>don't follow others (sic)
when they go insane. the system lives on the mean. that's where
things are stable</li>

<li>be patient
timing is key, too early you lose, too late you lose</li>

<li>be cautious
you lose if you stop prepping for problems</li>

<li>cycles everywhere</li>

<li><p>
learn how to get into chaos without being foolish
</p>

<p>
you have to tame fear, thus design plans to deal with all outcomes

<p>
i want to leave 'these persons' away.. i only feel happy when I
picture myself with others, I have remains of life in me, but I
can't express it with them.
</p>

<p>
part of it is the years of sadness in this house
</p>

<p>
part of it is the guilt of my maybe crime
</p>

<p>
part of it is .. i forgot. I shouldn't be editing text while I
listen to aerosmith.
</p>

<p>
since my breakup I have this feeling that interacting with people is
different, i need to be heard, i need genuine contact and honesty
and connection
</p>

<p>
it's a critical need
</p>

<p>
and every time I talk to my parents.. there's no such things, it's
fake, twisted, or silence
</p>

<p>
that's why I want them out.
</p>

<p>
they provided a roof.. but I can make a roof, it's not what I need
</p>

<p>
I scream in my head since i'm in college, nightmares and now pure
pain.
</p>

<p>
future looks bleak, i'm thinking of offing myself because I can't
deal with more grief, i cant kill them from my head either tbh.. but
it doesn't evolve well
</p>

<p>
I assume that's what people feel when marriage/couple doesn't work
and the other party cannot listen or make an effort.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes I want to scream, sing, make music to let the pain out,
the life out. But if feels so weak and so worthless now..
</p>

<p>
even anger or breaking things seems moot, I felt utterly defeated at
the store today.. a whole 20 years of life gone. vapor. Actually
that's a cute image. Even this whole failure is not nothing.. it
became vapor.
</p>

<p>
it's like i never lived, my impulses are gone, my desires are gone,
there's no blood
</p>

<p>
yet i have this void and this need to have some.. to have been
</p>

<p>
it hurts.
</p>

<p>
This is why I want to harm my mother(and father too) I think somehow
they deprived me of that. They never wanted to see me alive.. any
time I try I get shit or hurdles from them.
</p>

<p>
falling on your face is bliss

I wasn't able to live before, and i messed up, and now i'm guilty

I just got.

I despise.. or hate people that were around me at the time. They
didn't help.. are you responsible.. not really. But I expect them to
blame me fully when they'll know. Unfair. I wasn't capable of
dealing with these things. Honestly something was not there in my
brain. Oh well I could have but I was weak.. having a gf and feeling
love just made me stronger and opened my eyes to responsibilty.

I'll have to confess. I'll die because of it but I'll die human.

moving out is the best course of action.. it's a delicate matter.

I keep having memories of 'friends' i somehow hate.  Two things, I
wasn't happy at that time, and I did them wrong.  The childhood
memory that would have been a reason to forgive and evolve with them
a bit, as normal friend would do, is bruised and painful like my ex
memories. Since I had to kill her from my head.. I can kill anybody
from my head that makes me suffer.  It's inhuman.
</p>

<p>
Same for my parents, they're here but we don't talk.. I want to fix
the situation in theory.. but these are not my 'parents'.. these are
people that used to be my parents. People that would be somehow
empathetic to me.. I'm not screaming to my needs only, even when I
try to do good for all of us.. they cause me pain.

<p>
I should confess.. but it's a terminal loss loss situation.

Maybe I should consult a doctor.

oh, and right now I'm making money on speculation, i'm literally a
